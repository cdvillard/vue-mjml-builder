# Vue.js MJML Drag and Drop Builder

This project started out as an addition to another project of mine. I thought this builder could be interesting for other developers as well, so here it is.

If you have any questions, suggestions, additions or bugfixes, feel free to create an issue or a pull request.

I know that this project is far from finished, unpolished etc. This could also be a plugin instead of a whole web project. So I would say, see it as an inspiration instead of copy pasting the code. There is a lot of code that can be simplified by using mixins, typescript class functionalities and so on.

My goal is to being able to use it as a plugin at some point.
